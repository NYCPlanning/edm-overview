# **EDM Legal Requirements**

## Streets and addresses (CSCL and PAD)
Executive Order 39 of 1997 requires the following:

_Any information on newly-created streets or addresses will be transmitted to the City's emergency response agencies, who shall ensure that within five business days the newly identified locations are in their computer databases._

_The Department of City Planning will also input any new information into their Geosupport Computer System, which processes and updates New York City geographic locations. These locations can include addresses, street intersections, street stretches and property parcels. Utilizing this Geosupport System, the Department of Planning will help ensure that all emergency agencies have current, accurate information._

## Citywide statement of needs 
City Charter chapter 8, section 204 covers citywide statement of needs requirements. Part d specifies:

_"The statement of needs shall be accompanied by a map together with explanatory text, indicating (1) the location and current use of all city-owned real property, (2) all final commitments relating to the disposition or future use of city-owned real property, including assignments by the department of citywide administrative services pursuant to clause b of subdivision three of section sixteen hundred two, and (3) to the extent such information is available to the city, (i) the location of health and social service facilities operated by the state of New York or the federal government or pursuant to written agreement on behalf of the state or the federal government; and (ii) the location of transportation or waste management facilities operated by public entities or by private entities pursuant to written agreements with public entities, or by other private entities that provide comparable services. Information which can be presented most effectively in text may be presented in this manner. In addition to being transmitted with the statement of needs pursuant to subdivision a of this section, such map shall be kept on file with the department of city planning and shall be available for public inspection and copying. The map shall be updated on at least an annual basis."_

EDM maintains two datasets to meet these requirements, City Owned and Leased Properties (COLP) and Facilities Database (FacDB). The requirements for a map are met by Facilities Explorer, an application maintained by Planning Labs.

## Fair Share 
City Charter chapter 8, section 204 covers the criteria for the fair distribution of city facilities

Under section 203, the City Planning Commission is required to establish criteria _"to further the fair distribution among communities of the burdens and benefits associated with city facilities, consistent with community needs for services and efficient and cost effective delivery of services and with due regard for the social and economic impacts of such facilities upon the areas surrounding the sites."_ This criteria apply to _"(1) the location of new city facilities and (2) the significant expansion, closing or significant reduction in size or capacity for service delivery of existing facilities."_

City facilities are defined as _"a facility used or occupied or to be used or occupied to meet city needs that is located on real property owned or leased by the city or is operated by the city or pursuant to a written agreement on behalf of the city."_

Fair Share criteria require that the sponsoring agency and CPC consider "_the compatability of the facility with existing facilities and programs, both city and non-city, in the immediate vicinity of the site."_

City agencies use the Facilities Database (FacDB) and Facilities Explorer in their Fair Share analysis.

## Community District Boundaries
Community district boundaries are governed by the City Charter, chapter 69. Chapter 69 establishes the criteria for creating community district boundaries and the process for changing them. The mayor proposes changes, which the city council may adopt, adopt with modifications, or disapprove.

## Open Data
Local Law 11 of 2012 mandates that qualifying CIty-managed digital data be made available to the public-at-large through a single web portal. The law covers data that is _"Regularly created or maintained by or on behalf of and owned by an agency that records a measurement, transaction, or determination related to the mission of an agency."_
